▶ How to Run:

1. Open project in any IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / NetBeans / VS Code)
2. Locate Main.java
3. Run the file

📌 Future Enhancements:

You can extend this project in multiple ways:

-> Add database support (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
-> GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX
-> Generate salary slips
-> Authentication for administrators

🧩 Problem Statement:

Managing payroll manually becomes inefficient and error-prone when the number of employees grows. Organizations often need a system that can store employee details, compute salaries, and quickly retrieve or update the information. Traditional methods such as maintaining records in files or handwritten documents lead to:

-> Miscalculations of salary and deductions
-> Difficulty in tracking employee data
-> Time-consuming record maintenance
-> Lack of centralized information

The goal is to build a simple payroll system that helps maintain structured employee information and handle salary calculations in an organized and error-free manner.

✔ Solution Approach:

This project provides a structured Java application that manages employee records and calculates payroll efficiently. The solution includes:

1. Data Collection
-> Employees can be entered with relevant details such as name, ID, basic salary, etc.

2. Payroll Calculation
-> Salary components can be computed logically within the program (basic pay, allowances, deductions depending on implementation).

3. Data Storage in Memory
-> Employee entries are stored using Java collections, making retrieval faster and organized.

4. Modular Code Design
-> The code separates responsibilities into individual classes and methods, ensuring clarity and scalability.

5. Simple Interface
-> The system runs in a console environment, allowing step-by-step interaction for adding, displaying, and updating payroll details.

🎯 Outcome:

This project provides:
-> Quick employee detail management
-> Accurate salary calculations
-> Faster retrieval of information
-> Reduced manual effort
-> Good demonstration of core Java concepts
